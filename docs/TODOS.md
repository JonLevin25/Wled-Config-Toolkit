# Tool extraction TODOs

## TODOS
### Repo + flow test

6. Test FOSS repo flow
   - In VM: install Python 3.10
   - follow readme instructions
   - create conf file from example
   - test build+upload+verify wled-conf file

---

## v2 (NOT NOW)

- add tests
- Partial build support
- Renaming support (add json file, dont deal with cmdline args)
- JSON with comments / JSON5 support for wled-conf/cfg files? (build into JSONs)
- add "ip" property to wled-conf files, so you can define them inside the objects
- Automate fetching config into /data/fetched? (to get running configs for later override)

## v3

- Port to node.js?
- Nice GUI?
